# ctfdcm_instance (Resource)

CTFd is built around the Challenge resource, which contains all the attributes to define a part of the Capture The Flag event.

This implementation has support of On Demand infrastructures through [Chall-Manager](https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ctfdcm_challenge_dynamiciac" "chall" {
  name        = "Some challenge"
  category    = "cat"
  description = "..."
  value       = 500
  decay       = 20
  minimum     = 50
  state       = "visible"

  shared   = true
  scenario = "localhost:5000/some/scenario:v0.1.0"
}

resource "ctfd_user" "pandatix" {
  name     = "PandatiX"
  email    = "lucastesson@protonmail.com"

  ]
  captain = ctfd_user.pandatix.id
}

resource "ctfdcm_instance" "ist" {
